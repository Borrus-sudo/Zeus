   -R flag, pass a regex with this flag to display all dirents matching that regex 
   -B flag, pass a date with this flag to display all dirents created before the given date (MM/DD/YYYY format)
   -A flag, pass a date with this flag to display all dirents created after the given date (MM/DD/YYYY format)
   -P flag, pass a label with this flag to display all the folders classifying as the label or folders containing these such folders.
   -fd flag, pass a glob pattern to this flag to display all the files matching the glob pattern
   --ls flag, pass this to start Zeus in a non-interactive mode

    $ zeus -P node -fd index.{.js,.ts} --ls --icons
    $ zeus --ls --icons -R /package.json/ -B 11/11/2021
```
- **-R** flag, pass a regex with this flag to display all dirents matching that regex
- **-B** flag, pass a date with this flag to display all dirents created before the given date (MM/DD/YYYY format)
- **-A** flag, pass a date with this flag to display all dirents created after the given date (MM/DD/YYYY format)
- **-P** flag, pass a label with this flag to display all the folders classifying as the label or folders containing these such folders.
- **-fd** flag, pass a glob pattern to this flag to display all the files matching the glob pattern
- **--ls** flag, pass this to start Zeus in a non-interactive mode
- **--icons** flag, pass this to get icons based on your file extensions, the icons are customizable via the config file `.zeus.json` in your home directory.
- **--help** flag to get help
  In Zeus interactive mode (i.e. when the --ls flag is not passed) you can press `ctrl_o` on a file to open it in your preferred app (configurable via `.zeus.json` file). Pressing `ctrl_c` on a folder/file will copy its file path which will be pasted on pressing `ctrl_p` in your current working directory. When `ctrl_o` is pressed on a folder, Zeus will paste the cd command to that folder in the clipboard which can then be pasted in the terminal to FCD into it.

## Config file

```json
   "ignores": [],
   "queryIgnores": [],
   "openFile": "",
   "icons": {},
   "labels":[]
```

The above JSON file is the default schema of the config file.

- The **ignores** property will take the name of dirent (like .git,node_modules) or a specific directory, and Zeus shall not display it.
- The **queryIgnores** property will take the name of dirent (like .git,node_modules) or a specific directory, and Zeus shall not search within the matching folders or display matching files. Ignoring something does not make it queryIgnore and vice-versa.
- The **openFile** property takes a string in which ${PATH} will be replaced by the file path of the pressed dirent. For e.g. "notepad ${PATH}" or "code ${PATH}". It can also be an object where the value of the matching property based on the file extension will be taken. E.g. {".js":"code ${PATH}","default":"notepad ${PATH}"}. The default property is a fallback if none of the extensions match.
- The **icons** object allows users to prepend a glyph/emoji before specific files,file extensions or folders when --icons flag is passed. for e.g. {".js":"🎄","src/":"🎉"} It is important for folders to have a "/" in the ending.
- The **labels** property is an array of objects of the schema ```json {label: string, matchers: string[]} ```. The label is the name property is passed to the **-P** flag to display all the folders or folders containing such folders that will match all the glob patterns in the `matchers` property.
### Config file example

```json
{
  "ignores": [".git", "node_modules", "D:/Config.Msi"],
  "queryIgnores": ["D:/Config.Msi"],
  "openFile": {
    ".js": "code ${PATH}",
    "default": "notepad ${PATH}"
  },
  "icons": {
    ".js": "🎄",
    "src/": "🎉",
    "package.json": "📦"
  }
}
```

### Tips 💡

- If Zeus runs into an error like ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58482194/140915256-eebd0428-194f-4caf-b2ea-e543e401fbe7.png) then add the path, in this case, "D:\Config.Msi", in queryIgnores and ignores in the config file
- Zeus interactive mode has a type-to-search feature inbuilt!
