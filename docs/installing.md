# Installing

## Prerequisites
- Install node.js from the site https://nodejs.org/en/

Once node.js is installed you can clone this repo and install it globally by using the command `npm i -g`. The pkg will be soon be published to npm :)

_Note I have been unable to make it an exe because https://github.com/vercel/pkg is unable to bundle files properly (due to my dep terminal-kit). Contact me at BorrisX#2830 on discord if you have a solution!_
